								</header>
								<p>
                  Compressor flow instability with various time and length scales narrows the stable operating range of high pressure ratio centrifugal compressors. In this study, rig tests with fast-response
									pressure measurements are carried out on a high pressure ratio centrifugal compressor stage. The pathological map is depicted, and a flow control method is developed.
								</p>
								<p>
									Diverse instabilities have been identified through Fourier analysis, namely rotating instability, rotating stall, and surge in ascending order of time and length scale. At low speeds,
									small-scale rotating instability develops and evolves into rotating stall, which eventually triggers the compression system to surge. At middle speeds, the compressor successively experiences
									stable state, mild surge, rotating instability, and deep surge, where the mild surge region coincides with the inflection point of the compressor S-shape pressure rise characteristic. At high
									speeds, mild surge and deep surge abruptly occur without preceding rotating stall or rotating instability.
								</p>
								<p>
									Self-recirculation casing treatment is developed to suppress flow instabilities with various scales. Firstly, both the injection flow of the front slot and the suction flow of the rear slot will
									restrain the formation of radial vortex connecting the impeller suction surface and the casing wall, which is the cause of rotating instability and rotating stall. Secondly, the flow recirculation
									process turns the pressure rise slope of the impeller and the compressor stage more negative, which stabilizes the compression system and constrains surge.

									<h3><li> Transonic Flows in Centrifugal Compressors </li></h2>
								</header>
								<p>
                  Transonic flows with shocks waves and shock interactions occur in high pressure ratio centrifugal compressors, which further deteriorates the complex flow field and lowers the compressor efficiency.
									This study numerically investigates the loss mechanism of centrifugal compressors under transonic inlet conditions, and the potential of three-dimensional blades to recover the loss of efficiency.
								</p>
								<p>
                  By defining an entropy-based parameter, the loss generation process is monitored in RANS CFD. It is found that the shock interactions contributed to an enhanced wake region and thus an increased local
									loss. Therefore, flow control methods that relieve the shock interaction are promising to increase compressor efficiency. Inspired by the three-dimensional nature of the shock front, the three-dimensional
									leading edge of the impeller was proposed to control the shock structure accordingly. Simplified flow models of each degree of freedom (i.e. sweep and lean) were built to complement the understanding of
									their aerodynamic effects. An optimal shape was obtained through optimization.
